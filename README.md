# React Cooking Ninja App

This project was created using React as framework & Firebase as database.

In this app, users can view different recipes, create new recipes, delete recipes, or search for recipes. (interacting with firestore)

Besides, users can also switch between dark & light mode, and change the navbar style to other colors. (using context API & useReducer hook)
